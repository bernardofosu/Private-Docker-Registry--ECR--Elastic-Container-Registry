Tag tips & pushing later (optional)

Local only:
```sh
docker build -t myapp .
docker tag myapp myapp:v1
```

For ECR:
```sh
docker tag myapp:latest 440744234244.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/myapp:latest
docker push 440744234244.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/myapp:latest
```

🔹 npm init -y

This command initializes a new Node.js project in the current folder.

It creates a package.json file with default values.

The -y flag means “yes to all defaults” (so it skips the interactive questions).

Example output in package.json:

{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",   👈
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

🔹 "main": "index.js"

The "main" field defines the entry point when your package is required by another app.

By default, it’s set to "index.js".

For most apps, this field doesn’t affect npm start directly — it’s more relevant when you publish a library to npm.

🔹 Should you change it to server.js or app.js?

If you’re writing a standalone app (like an Express server):

You usually create server.js or app.js.

In that case, you can either:

Leave "main": "index.js" and just run your file directly with Node:

node server.js


Or edit package.json to match your file:

"main": "server.js"


If you’re building a library to publish on npm:

"main" should point to the file that exports your module’s functionality.

🔹 For starting apps

Normally you add a script:

"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js"
}


Then run:

npm start


✅ Summary

npm init -y = quick project setup with defaults.

"main" = entry file when the package is required.

For apps, it’s common to rename it to server.js or app.js, but it only matters if you’re publishing or relying on "main".
